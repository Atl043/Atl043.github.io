            <p class="lead">In the Chen Lab, I am the Lead
                Software Engineer and have been in the lab since 2016.
                I was able to work with graduate students and leverage both my
                computer science background to develop software Applications for
                3D Biolight Printer.</p>

            <h2 class="h3">A little background...</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Chen Lab</strong> creates custom built
                3D Biolight printers to conducts its research in developing 3D
                bioprinting
                techniques with a micro or nanoscale printing resolution. They
                also
                explore novel nanomaterials and biomaterials for tissue
                engineering applications
                using stem cells. There are mainly Nanoengineers,Chemical,
                Bioengineers in the lab, and a couple Computer Science students
                to work on the printer.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h3">What I worked on</h2>
            <p>I work on developing a 3-teir web application and
                .NET applications for these 3D Biolight printers. I also updated
                and now maintain the
                <a href="http://schen.ucsd.edu/lab/">Lab Website</a>.
                The primary task is to communicate commands, usually using
                Serial
                Ports, to specific hardware and once combined together creates a
                full on 3D Biolight Printer. Some of the devices are as old as
                1997, when I was born, so working with such devices can pose a
                challenge. But since devices from 1997 are better, it is key to
                maintain them. I also developed a system of
                version control (Github), preservation of software in the lab,
                and
                documentation in the lab.
                My main skills used are C#, JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML5/CSS3,
                Golang, and
                understanding of hardware serial port communication.
                Note I cannot talk more about this in detail, but feel free to
                contact me to know more.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px">What I learned</h2>
            <h3>.NET and C#</h3>
            <p>
                Most of my experience is working with Java before joining the
                lab, but was able to pick up C# to more simply create
                applications for the many different Hardware components. This is
                due to many of the unique hardware we purchase have online
                packages in the .NET framework and the ease of creating a
                frontend to develop such software.

            </p>
            <h3>Hardware and Software Integration</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the nature of the work, I need to create applications for
                many hardware components. In order to do so, I needed to learn
                many different ways to communicate with these components. Of
                which Serial port communication is the most prevalent, where you
                send information via bytes to the device directly. Now knowing
                the hardware constraints of the device, I needed to integrate as
                many as 5 devices together into a single software application
                and make sure it would run efficiently and in correct order.
            </p>
            <h3>ReactJS:</h3>
            <p>This was my first experience with this language, and it was
                similar enough to HTML5 and CSS3 to allow me to think how it
                would be perfect to the user to learn.
            </p>
            <h3>Golang</h3>
            <p>
                Golang or go is an open source programming language from google.
                The
                graduate student, I initially worked with, wanted me to learn
                this language to implement
                the backend. Go has easy to write concurrent and efficient to
                manage concurrency code. Go seems similar to C, but with memory
                safety,
                garbage collection, structural typing. This is a great language
                to use in my lab as it would allow us to do prints faster and
                quicker than before as a single goroutine can run on multiple
                threads. But since this is a new
                language, there is not much online tutorials or development
                packages in
                this langauge yet to be useful long term in my lab as of 2019
                Feb due to
                student developers coming in and out constantly in our lab. Also
                due to the fact many other printers in our 4 other printers in
                the lab use .NET framework.
            </p>
            <h3>Project Management and Leading the Software Development</h3>
            <p>
                In my Junior and Senior year at UCSD, I offically became the
                Lead Software Developer of the lab. I have to manage the <a
                    href="http://schen.ucsd.edu/lab/">Lab Website</a> and
                develop for the multiple 3D Biolight Printers. One of the main
                problems I noticed in the lab when I first joined in 2016 was
                the lack of documentation for software and the lack of any
                version control for the software of the lab. One time was that a
                literal computer died and had a specific software written 10
                years ago by some graduate student. The problem was they never
                had another copy of the software nor any documentation of how to
                use it.
                People were just learning how to use it by someone before them
                using it. I thus implemented a version control system using a
                lab specific github account and documentation standards.
            </p>
            <p>Another problem was the lack of comments in code as well as many
                developers in the lab leave without passing their knowledge to
                the next generation of the lab. I worked to comment and
                understand every application in the lab and train a another
                undergraduate developer to continue the advancements of research
                in the lab</p>
