                    Division</h3>
            </a>
            <p class="lead">At L3T, I worked on both the <a href="https://www2.l3t.com/trf/incontrol/index.htm">
                    InControl</a> team and the OnTime scheduling team as a
                Software Engineer Intern
                during summer of 2018. I was able to work with two other
                interns and leverage both my
                mathematics and computer science backgrounds.</p>
            <div class="row">

            </div><br>
            <h2>A little background...</h2>
            <p class="textLeft">The <strong>InControl Team</strong> at L3T generally
                is in charge of Satellite Command and Control Software for
                On-Orbit, Factory Test and Ground
                System Monitor and Control. The software designed from the
                ground up to manage
                satellite constellations with one control center.
                Companys like Iridium
                use our software to manage their constellation of satellites.
                While working with the
                team, I was also
                exposed to their OnTime scheduling app.</p>
            <h2>What I worked on</h2>
            <p class="textLeft">I was able to work in a Agile software development process and
                implemented requests for the RESTful API and allowed it to send
                data to the web app
                and created tests for the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE Requests.
                I also worked on creating and debugging parts of their ReactJS
                web application. Due to my skill in ReactJs my boss introduced
                me into the OnTime Project, a scheduling application, where I
                had to learn more advanced JavaScript and CSS.
                My main skills used where Java, JavaScript, ReactJS, and CSS.
            </p>
            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <h3 class="textLeft">RESTful API:</h3>
            <p class="textLeft2">I was able to explore a completely new thing that isn't taught at
                school and due to my ability to learn quickly, I was able to
                actually implement and simply call a url to get a json formated
                data.
            </p>
            <h3 class="textLeft">Kanban Agile Software Development Process:</h3>
            <p class="textLeft2">
                In this experience, I worked in an agile software development
                process with Kanban due to the constant customer feedback. I
                would participate in our daily standup meetings and give a short
                description of what I was able to do and what I plan to work on
                that day. We focused on the customer and their experience with
                the application. We did this by using tools such as
                Jira and Confluence to help our development process.
            </p>
            <h3 class="textLeft">ReactJS:</h3>
            <p class="textLeft2">My experience with ReactJs was limited to the web applications
                at the Chen Lab. But at L3T, I was able to develop more skills
                while developing ReactJS Web applications. I was able to learn
                debugging tools as well as debugging procedures when I was given
                ReactJS tasks and bugs. Such as being able to help a PM quickly
                find the cause of a bug and fix it. Due to implementing the
                RESTful API, I
                also worked with linking the frontend to the RESTful API I just
                recently implemented.
                ReactJs is not taught extensively at my school so this was great
                experience to grow my ReactJs skills.
            </p>
            <h3 class="textLeft">JavaScript, CSS:</h3>
            <p class="textLeft2">
                Unlike my ReactJs experience, I only barely knew JavaScript and
                had no prior experience with it. But due to my PM needing help
                on the OnTime Project and me sensing the chance to learn
                something new, I jumped at the opportunity to gain valuable
                experience in JavaScript. I was able to take a JavaScript
                component and
                modify it to implement new features. Note: I cannot get into
                details much more about this but feel free to contact me if
                you'd like more info.
